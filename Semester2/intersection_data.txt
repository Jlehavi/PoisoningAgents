Intersection Driving Knowledge Base

Basic Observations:
- Your vehicle is navigating through an intersection with other vehicles
- Vehicles may approach from different directions (north, south, east, west)
- You need to reach destination "o1" safely
- Features include presence, x, y, vx, vy, cos_h, sin_h
- Absolute coordinates are used

Actions:
0: LANE_LEFT - Turn left
1: IDLE - Continue straight 
2: LANE_RIGHT - Turn right

Safety Rules:
1. Always yield to vehicles that have the right of way
2. Do not enter the intersection when another vehicle is crossing your path
3. Wait for oncoming traffic to clear before making a left turn
4. Be aware of vehicles approaching from perpendicular roads
5. If there's a risk of collision, stay idle (action 1) until it's safe to proceed
6. Keep a safe distance from other vehicles within the intersection

Decision Making:
- If you need to turn left and no vehicles are approaching from the opposite direction, use LANE_LEFT
- If you need to go straight and the path ahead is clear, use IDLE
- If you need to turn right and there are no vehicles in your path, use LANE_RIGHT
- When multiple vehicles are in the intersection, wait for them to pass before proceeding
- If another vehicle has the right of way, allow them to pass before making your move
- If an immediate collision risk exists, stay idle until it's safe to proceed

Example Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Vehicle approaching from opposite direction, you need to turn left
Action: IDLE (wait for the vehicle to pass before turning)

Scenario 2: Intersection is clear, you need to go straight
Action: IDLE (continue straight through the intersection)

Scenario 3: Vehicle approaching from the left, you need to turn right
Action: IDLE (wait for the vehicle to pass, then turn right)

Scenario 4: No vehicles in the intersection, you need to turn left
Action: LANE_LEFT (safe to make the left turn)

Scenario 5: Vehicle approaching from the right has right of way
Action: IDLE (wait for the vehicle to pass before proceeding)
