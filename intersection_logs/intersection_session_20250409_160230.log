[16:02:32.871] [Agent 2] Collision risks: {'imminent_collision': True, 'vehicles_on_collision_path': [{'vehicle_id': 1, 'distance': np.float32(0.6555554), 'heading_diff': np.float32(89.99999)}, {'vehicle_id': 2, 'distance': np.float32(0.66224384), 'heading_diff': np.float32(89.99999)}]}
[16:02:33.897] [Agent 2] Action: 0 (SLOWER + LEFT)
[16:02:33.897] [Agent 2] Reasoning: Slowing down is necessary to avoid a potential collision with vehicle #3, which is approaching from the opposite direction.

[16:02:35.537] [Agent 1] Collision risks: {'imminent_collision': True, 'vehicles_on_collision_path': [{'vehicle_id': 1, 'distance': np.float32(0.4499876), 'heading_diff': np.float32(90.0)}, {'vehicle_id': 2, 'distance': np.float32(0.44343346), 'heading_diff': np.float32(89.99999)}]}
[16:02:36.257] [Agent 1] Action: 1 (IDLE + LEFT)
[16:02:36.257] [Agent 1] Reasoning: Maintain speed left to safely navigate the turn as there is no immediate collision risk with oncoming traffic.

[16:02:38.610] [Agent 0] Action: 0 (SLOWER + LEFT)
[16:02:38.611] [Agent 0] Reasoning: Slowing down is necessary to yield to the oncoming vehicle in row 1, which has the right of way.
[16:02:38.612] [Agent 1] Observation: 5 nearby vehicles
[16:02:38.613] [Agent 1] Collision risks: {'imminent_collision': True, 'vehicles_on_collision_path': [{'vehicle_id': 1, 'distance': np.float32(0.18026654), 'heading_diff': np.float32(90.0)}, {'vehicle_id': 2, 'distance': np.float32(0.17499061), 'heading_diff': np.float32(90.61042)}, {'vehicle_id': 3, 'distance': np.float32(0.98644555), 'heading_diff': np.float32(89.99999)}]}
[16:02:40.024] [Agent 1] Action: 1 (IDLE + LEFT)
[16:02:40.025] [Agent 1] Reasoning: Maintain speed while turning left as there is no immediate collision risk and the path is clear of oncoming traffic.
