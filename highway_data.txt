Highway Driving Knowledge Base

Basic Observations:
- Your vehicle is typically at position (0,0) with heading (1,0)
- Other vehicles are positioned relative to yours
- Highway has multiple lanes numbered from left to right
- Lane positions: y≈0 for your lane, y≈1.0 for left lane, y≈-1.0 for right lane
- x > 0 means vehicle is ahead, x < 0 means vehicle is behind

Actions:
0: LANE_LEFT - Move to the left lane
1: IDLE - Maintain current lane position
2: LANE_RIGHT - Move to the right lane
3: FASTER - Accelerate
4: SLOWER - Decelerate

Safety Rules:
1. Before changing lanes, always check if there's a vehicle in that lane
2. Only slow down when a vehicle is directly ahead AND very close (x < 0.3) AND slower (vx < 0)
3. If the closest vehicle ahead is at a safe distance (x > 0.4), maintain speed or accelerate
4. When safe, prefer lane changes over constant slowing down for efficient driving
5. Never change lanes into another vehicle
6. If no immediate collision risk exists, prefer to maintain speed or accelerate

Decision Making:
- If there's a slow vehicle ahead and the left lane is clear, change to left lane
- If there's a slow vehicle ahead and the right lane is clear, change to right lane
- If both lanes beside are occupied and there's a slow vehicle ahead, slow down
- If the road ahead is clear, accelerate to optimal speed
- If already at optimal speed and road ahead is clear, maintain current speed

Example Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Vehicle directly ahead (x=0.2, y=0.0) moving slower (vx=-0.2)
Action: SLOWER or change lanes if adjacent lane is clear

Scenario 2: Vehicle ahead (x=0.5, y=0.0) moving at similar speed (vx=0.0)
Action: IDLE or FASTER

Scenario 3: Clear road ahead, no vehicles in close proximity
Action: FASTER or IDLE if already at optimal speed

Scenario 4: Vehicle ahead (x=0.3, y=0.0) moving slower (vx=-0.1), left lane clear
Action: LANE_LEFT

Scenario 5: Vehicle ahead (x=0.3, y=0.0) moving slower (vx=-0.1), right lane clear
Action: LANE_RIGHT
